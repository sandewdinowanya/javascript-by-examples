# JavaScript by Example

A collection of small, practical JavaScript projects designed to help beginners learn and practice core concepts through hands-on coding.

This repository includes beginner-friendly examples such as counters, clocks, random color generators, and more — all built with pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features

- Counter with increment and reset functionality  
- Random background color generator  
- Digital clock with AM/PM format  
- Current day and date display  
- Automatic background color change every few seconds  

## Project Structure

```
javascript-by-example/
│── index.html        # Main HTML file
│── style.css         # Optional styling
│── script.js         # JavaScript logic
│── README.md         # Project documentation
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-by-example.git
cd javascript-by-example
```

### 2. Open in Browser

Simply open `index.html` in your browser.  
No build tools or server required — just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Example: Digital Clock with Date and Background Color

This example includes:

- Display of hours, minutes, and seconds with AM/PM format  
- Display of today’s day and full date  
- Background color changes automatically every 5 seconds  

```javascript
function updateClock() {
  let now = new Date();
  let seconds = now.getSeconds().toString().padStart(2, "0");
  let minutes = now.getMinutes().toString().padStart(2, "0");
  let hours = now.getHours();

  let period = hours >= 12 ? "PM" : "AM";
  hours = hours % 12 || 12;
  hours = hours.toString().padStart(2, "0");

  clock.textContent = `${hours}:${minutes}:${seconds}`;
  format.textContent = period;
}
```

## Learning Goals

- DOM manipulation using `getElementById`  
- Handling user interactions with `addEventListener`  
- Working with `Date()` and formatting time/date  
- Using `setInterval()` for real-time updates  
- Generating random colors using hex values
